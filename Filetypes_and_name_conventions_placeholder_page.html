<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Filetypes-</strong></span></p>
<p>Mod/tool based:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.pose</strong></span> - A file containing pose and bone data for use with posing tools. Originated from the Anamnesis tool, but is also used by Ktisis, Brio, Customize+ (scale only), and the Ana Blender Pose Helper plugin.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.chara</strong></span><strong> </strong>- A file containing character creation and extended appearance data used for Creating/Loading characters. Originated from the Anamnesis tool, but can also be used by Glamourer (?), Ktisis(?), and Brio (?). This file is similar to a JSON (?) and can be opened in a text editor software like Notepad to see the raw values.</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.cmp</strong></span> - Concept Matrix Pose. the equivalent of a .pose file, but for the now defunct tool, CMTools. These files can no longer be created and should be converted to .pose files at your earliest convenience for maximum compatibility. Current tools that support reading this format are Anamnesis and Ktisis.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.cma</strong></span> - Concept Matrix Appearance. The equivalent of a .chara file, but for the now defunct tool, CMTools. These files can no longer be created and should be converted to .chara files at your earliest convenience for maximum compatibility. Current tool(s) that support this format are Anamnesis.</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.profile</strong></span> - A file that contains a Customize+ scaling profile. This filetype is now defunct and Customize+ no longer uses it. Please convert all .profile files into either .pose files (only scaling data) or Customize+ Clipboard strings (Position, Rotation, and Scale data) if you wish to share this data.</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.ttmp/.ttmp2</strong> </span>- Textools Mod Packages. These files are mod files that contain data such as textures, materials, vfx, animations, models, skeletons, ect. if you are downloading a fully packaged mod, the end file that you import should be either one of these, or a PMP. These files can be read by BOTH Textools (an external mod loader and editor) and Penumbra (a plugin based mod loader and editor).</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.pmp</strong> </span>- Penumbra Mod Packages. These files are mod files that contain data such as textures, materials, vfx, animations, models, skeletons, ect. if you are downloading a fully packaged mod, the end file that you import should be either one of these, or a TTMP/TTMP2. These files can ONLY be read by Penumbra.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.mcdf</strong></span> - Mare Character Data File. A file generated by Mare Synchronos that contains the exact apperance and all mods used at the time of saving of a specific character. These are similar to .chara files, but they also contain the mods used at the time. these are not editable by design, to prevent abuse. Current programs that can read these files; Mare Synchronos, Brio.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.scd</strong></span> - Sound file (?). A file that contains sound effects or music that can be created in VFXEditor. (going to be real I don't know much about this one please help me animation modders)</li>
</ul>
<p>General Filetypes-</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.json</strong></span><strong> </strong>- A text based file format that stores data in both a computer readable way, and a human readable way. It has many applications, so each json will have a slightly different use case and structure based on the program writing it. Can be opened and read using simple text software such as Notepad.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.7z</strong></span><strong> </strong>- 7zip Archive. This is an archived or compressed file format similar to .zip, but generally compresses to be smaller, and has extra security options. Requires either 7zip or WinRar to extract to a normal file folder. these files MUST be extracted into a normal folder in order for most programs to read them.</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.zip</strong></span><strong> </strong>- An Archived or compressed file folder. This is a standard format used for sending multiple files at once in one file, and reducing storage space. This format is standard and comes automatically with Windows, Mac(?), and Linux(?); and can be extracted/uncompressed without additional software.</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.rar&nbsp;</strong></span> - WinRaR Archive. This is an archived or compressed file format similar to .zip, but generally compresses to be smaller, and has extra security options. Requires either 7zip or WinRar to extract to a normal file folder. these files MUST be extracted into a normal folder in order for most programs to read them.</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.blend</strong></span><strong> </strong>- Blender Project File. This is a file that is <i>exclusive to blender</i> and cannot be opened by other programs. It is a working filetype, meaning that it contains all data needed to continue working on a project. In the 14 modding sphere, these are usually distributed as Development kits for Body mods, or scaling kits for body mods.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.3ds </strong></span>- 3DS Max Project file. This is a file that is <i>exclusive to 3ds Max</i> and cannot be opened by other programs. It is a working filetype, meaning that it contains all data needed to continue working on a project. In the 14 modding sphere, these are usually distributed as Development kits for Body mods, or scaling kits for body mods.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.dae</strong></span><strong> </strong>- Digital Asset Exchange file. This is an exported filetype for 3d models/meshes. It is an old filetype and is no longer used by most applications, but can be read and exported to from TexTools. It is recommended to avoid this filetype when possible as it is old and contains less data than other finished filetypes.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.png </strong></span>- Transparent 2d image file. this is one of the most common filetypes for flattened images, and it supports transparency via an Alpha channel. This format has lossless/semi lossless compression, and is best for files that need to be repeatedly opened and edited.</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.jpg/.jpeg</strong></span><strong> </strong>- 2d image file (no transparency). This is the other most common filetypes for flattened images. It does NOT support transparency and does not use an alpha channel. This format is more destructive as it's compression causes loss of data every time the image is edited or re saved, however it it popular for web hosted images as it compresses smaller than PNG.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.dds</strong></span> - Texture specific image file. This is an image file specifically created for storing textures with a unique compression method that causes the least loss of those used in 14 modding. It supports transparency via an alpha channel. When making texture mods that utilize an alpha channel, it is best to use this format if possible. Currently only Photoshop and Gimp can open and save these files.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.fbx</strong></span> - 3d model file format. This is an exported file format that stores 3d model data, animation data, texture/material data, camera data, and other 3d data. It is a proprietary format created by Autodesk, but many other programs can read and write this file format. This is currently the industry standard file format due to it's age, compatibility, and the amount of data stored. It is NOT a working format, so some scene data will be uneditable. As a note- Penumbra does not have plans to use this format for it's model import/export. Please see the other 3d formats listed here, or use TexTools.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.obj</strong></span><strong> </strong>- 3d model file format. This is an exported file format that stores 3d data. It stores the least data of any other popular 3d file format, which makes it the most compatible, but also one of the worst formats to use for modding. It only contains mesh/geometry data. This is not a working format and should only be used if you want the model data and nothing else. As a note- Penumbra does not have plans to use this format for it's model import/export. Please see the other 3d formats listed here or use TexTools.</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.gltf/.glb</strong></span><strong> </strong>- Open Source 3d model file format. This format is very similar to the FBX format, and is an Open Source alternative to FBX, as they store the same types of data. The only difference between gltf and glb is that gltf is based on json, and glb is binary. This format is new and not widely compatible with all programs. It is recommended to use blender to convert to or from gltf/glb if needed. Currently of the 3d modeling softwares, only Blender natively supports GLTF/GLB. 3ds max can export the format but not import it, and Maya requires paid third party plugins to import and export. As a note - Textools cannot read/write this format, and it is currently only used by penumbra as far as modding tools.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.psd</strong></span> - Photoshop Document. this is a Photoshop Project file that is proprietary to Adobe Photoshop, but it has become the industry standard 2d project file, as just about every image program that supports layers can read and write to this file. It is an image file that supports transparency and layers, as well as layer styles and other 2d data. It is a working file format, and is mainly used for editing and retaining layer and group data. These are commonly used in the ff14 community for skin texture mods that are meant to be easily editable by the user. All modding programs can not use the .psd format, and it must be exported to a .png, .dds, or .jpg/jpeg.</li>
</ul>
<p>14 specific-&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.tex </strong></span>- This is a ff14 texture file. the game uses these to read and write it's texture data. this cannot currently be created or edited by any program, only exported as-is or imported as-is by modding software. in order to edit a .tex file, you will need to export it to a file format that can be used by non-14 programs such as .dds or .png.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.mdl</strong></span><strong> </strong>- this is a ff14 model file. this is NOT the same as 3ds max's .mdl files, and they will error if you try to open them there. the game uses these to write it's model data. this cannot currently be created or edited by any program, only exported as-is or imported as-is by modding software. In order to edit a .mdl file, you will need to export it to a file format that can be used by non-14 programs such as Fbx or GLTF/GLB.</li>
  <li><span class="text-big"><strong>.mtrl</strong></span><strong> </strong>- This is a ff14 material file. The game uses these to read and write it's material data.</li>
